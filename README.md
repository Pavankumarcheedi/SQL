### 📂2. [DataMigration Project](./Datamigration)

This project focuses on migrating structured business data from CSV files stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) into a SQL Server database. Using Python and `pyodbc`, the solution connects to SQL Server Express and automates the data insertion process into predefined tables. SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) was used to design and verify the database structure. This workflow ensures secure, scalable, and efficient data handling for further analytics and reporting.
