# ðŸ§  NFT Sales Data Analysis using SQL

This project involves analyzing a dataset of NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collections using **advanced SQL techniques** such as subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and window functions.

## ðŸ“¦ About the Datasets

The datasets used in these projects are publicly available and sourced primarily from platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and open data repositories. All files are used strictly for educational and learning purposes.
